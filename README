Goal:
    Create a command-line based utility to create decklists. Card names are going to be validated through
    the scryfall.com API. Currently, decklists are saved as plaintext. However, a future implementation will
    allow for decks to be output to a PDF file in either text or card image formats (for proxying etc).

Compilation & run instructions:
    >$ cd decklist-tool
    >$ python3 main.py

Usage:
    - Generally, follow the prompts on-screen.
    - Card names are accepted in the following format: `[n] {card name}`. If n is omitted, one copy of the card
    will be added to the deck. n cannot be greater than a format-specified number of cards, except, of course,
    for the six basic land types.
    - To quit the card-adding repl, type either QUIT or Q.

Ideal use cycle:
    1. run the utility
        - flags to specify what type of output is desired (txt, pdf decklist, pdf proxies)
    2. specify the deck's name and format
    3. enter a repl-type of input style, where the user enters card quantities and names
    4. when the user is done entering cards, generate the desired output format

Future Work:
    - command line flags
        - enable/disable card name validation
        - type of output (default to on-screen, allow user to specify txt, pdf text, or pdf image)
    - card format legality validation
    - add the ability to read and old decklist from a file
    - print decklist to a PDF
    - print card images to a PDF
    - add the ability to delineate a sideboard
