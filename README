Goal:
    Create a command-line based utility to create decklists. Card names are going to be validated through
    the scryfall.com API. Currently, decklists are saved as plaintext. However, a future implementation will
    allow for decks to be output to a PDF file in either text or card image formats (for proxying etc)
Compilation & run instructions:
    >$ cd decklist-tool
    >$ python3 main.py


Future Work:
    - command line flags
        - eg, only one of each card, 4 of each card, etc
        - format of the deck?
        - enable/disable card checking
    - card validation
    - validate the number of cards allowed in a deck
    - Print decklist to a PDF
    - Print card images to a PDF
