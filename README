Goal:
    Create a command-line based utility to create decklists. Card names are going to be validated through
    the scryfall.com API. Currently, decklists are saved as plaintext. However, a future implementation will
    allow for decks to be output to a PDF file in either text or card image formats (for proxying etc)
Compilation & run instructions:
    >$ cd decklist-tool
    >$ python3 main.py
